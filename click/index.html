				The video game market has experienced exponential growth in recent years, and the trend continues to
				rise. Play-to-Earn blockchain-based games have taken the industry by storm, offering a new way for
				players to earn money while having fun.
				<br>
				CLICK is a Play-to-Earn game based on the Polygon blockchain
				technology that allows players to earn rewards in CLICK tokens by playing the game.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Objective: </h2>
				<br>
				The objective of CLICK is to create an accessible Play-to-Earn gaming platform for all players,
				using blockchain technology to ensure platform security and transparency.

				in CLICK tokens by playing the game and use these rewards to improve their NFTs and enhance their
				performance in the game.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
				<br>
				CLICK is a click-based game where players have to click on the screen to earn rewards in
				CLICK tokens. Rewards can be used to buy, upgrade, and sell NFTs on the platform, allowing players
				to earn even more CLICK tokens. NFTs can be collected, traded, and used to earn additional rewards
				in the game.
				<br><br>
				<h2>CLICK Token:</h2>
				<br>
				The CLICK token is the native cryptocurrency of the CLICK platform, used to reward players based on
				their performance and engagement in the game.
				<br>
				CLICK tokens can be used to buy, upgrade, and sell
				NFTs on the platform, as well as traded on cryptocurrency exchange platforms.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Governance Mechanisms:</h2>
				<br>
				CLICK also uses decentralized governance mechanisms to give users greater control over the platform.
				<br>
				Users can vote to make important decisions regarding game development, ensuring an active and
				engaged community.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
				<br>
				CLICK is a promising Play-to-Earn project based on the Polygon blockchain technology, offering a
				unique opportunity for players to earn money while having fun. The click-based gameplay is simple
				and accessible to all players, and decentralized governance mechanisms ensure an active and engaged
				community.
				<br>
				The CLICK token also offers opportunities for additional earnings, as well as practical
				use to buy, upgrade, and sell NFTs on the platform.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Tokénomics:</h2>
				<br>
				The CLICK token is the native cryptocurrency of the CLICK platform, with a total supply of 10
				billion tokens. Tokens will be distributed as follows:
				<br>
				<b>50% (5 billion)</b> will be allocated to the community, including rewards for players, referral
				programs, events, etc.
				<br>
				<b>20% (2 billion)</b> will be allocated to the CLICK team, which will be used to fund game development,
				operations, partnerships, etc.
				<br>
				<b>10% (1 billion)</b> will be allocated to a treasury fund, which will be used for long-term
				development
				expenses and future platform needs.
				<br>
				<b>20% (2 billion)</b> will be allocated to the public sale of tokens, which will be organized to allow
				the
				community to buy CLICK tokens at an initial price.
				<br><br>
				Token distribution will be progressive, with a portion of the tokens unlocked at regular intervals
				to ensure stability in the market.
				<br>
				Decentralized governance mechanisms will also allow the community
				to vote on decisions related to fund allocation and the use of CLICK tokens.
				<br>
				The CLICK token will also have practical use on the CLICK platform, where players can use their
				tokens to buy, upgrade, and sell NFTs, as well as unlock special features in the game. Additionally,
				CLICK token holders can participate in staking and farming programs to earn additional rewards in
				CLICK tokens.
				<br>
				Overall, CLICK Tokénomics will reward players for their active participation on the platform, while
				ensuring a balanced allocation of tokens for long-term platform development and for investors who
				have supported the project.
